     *    __ TIPS:
     *       @1 * [Every configuration variable starts it's name with '_' character (underline)]
     * 
     *    __ RESUME: 
     *    
     *       In lines [36] to [38], there are configuration variables that allows the javascript
     *       to identify in the HTML structure the elements that it will work on, by using CSS classes.
     * 
     *       According to /README.md, in order to change the default CSS classes configuration,
     *       it's just needed to change the variable string attribution to a preferred one.
     * 
     *       ---
     *    
     *       In line [40], there is a configuration object with properties that controls
     *       the delay and the timing function to be executed.
