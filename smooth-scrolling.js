       *       @1 * [Every configuration variable starts it's name with '_' character (underline).]

       *    __ RESUME: 
       *    
       *       In lines [17] to [19], there are configuration variables that allows the javascript
       *       to identify in the HTML structure the elements that it will work on, by using CSS classes.
       * 
       *       According to /README.md, in order to change the default CSS classes configuration,
       *       it's just needed to change the variable string attribution to a preferred one.
